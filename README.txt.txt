This project is made by Samyak Bhattacharya, college: B.P Poddar Institute of Management and Technology.

This is a simple login/signup page Project.

For frontend, I used basic html,css and javascript
For backend, I used nodejs,expressjs
Database used here is Mongodb
The server will run on localhost:7000

I have kept the login and signup page simple with a little bit of animation.
The website is very much Responsive.
I didn't bcrypt/hashed the password that is getting stored in the database

Thank You!
